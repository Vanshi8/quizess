participating students, and view detailed results to assess learning outcomes. The 
platform is built using [mention your technologies, e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
PHP, MySQL], offering an easy-to-use interface and efficient backend processing. 
Quizess aims to enhance the learning experience by providing immediate feedback 
to students and valuable insights to teachers for tracking progress and improving 
teaching methods.
